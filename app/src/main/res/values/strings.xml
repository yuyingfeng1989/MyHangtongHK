<string name="privacy_article">Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share and store your personal data when you create a Liteguardian account.or other Liteguardian websites and apps covered by this privacy policy.
\r\nHere we describe the privacy practices for our devices, applications, software, websites, API, products, and services (the“Services”). You will learn about the data we collect, how we use it, the controls we give you over your information, and the measures we take to keep it safe.

\r\n<b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
\r\nWhen you use our Services, we collect the following types of information.
\r\n<b>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US</b>
\r\n<b>ACCOUNT INFORMATION</b>
\r\nSome information is required to create an account on our Services, such as your name, email address, password, date of birth, gender, height, weight, and in some cases your mobile telephone number. This is the only information you have to provide to create an account with us. You may also choose to provide other types of information, such as a profile photo, biography, country information and username.
\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b>
\r\nTo help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information.
\r\nIf you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect the information you submit such as your name, contact information, and message.
\r\n<b>PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION</b>
\r\nSome Liteguardian devices support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this feature, you must provide certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to your device a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number. We do not store your transaction history.Note that third-party payment processors may retain this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms.

\r\n<b>INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES</b>
\r\n<b>DEVICE INFORMATION</b>
\r\nYour device collects data to estimate a variety of metrics like the number of steps you take, your distance travelled, calories burned, weight, heart rate, sleep stages, active minutes and location. The data collected varies depending on which device you use. Learn more about the features of our various devices. When your device syncs with our applications or software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device to our servers.
\r\n<b>LOCATION INFORMATION</b>
\r\nThe Services include features that use precise location data, including GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. We collect this type of data if you grant us access to your location. 
\r\n<b>USAGE INFORMATION</b>
\r\nWhen you access or use our Services, we receive certain usage data. This includes information about your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search content, install applications or software, create or log into your account, pair your device to your account, or open or interact with an application on your Liteguardian device.
\r\nWe also collect data about the devices and computers you use to access the Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, Liteguardian or mobile device information (including device and application identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the permissions you have granted us), and cookie information.

\r\n<b>OW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>
\r\nWe may process your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Liteguardian is subject or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Liteguardian or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.
\r\nThe personal information we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
\r\nWe also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us. We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.

\r\nWe give you account settings and tools to access and control your personal data, as described below, regardless of where you live. If you live in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland (the “Designated Countries”), you have a number of legal rights with respect to your information, which your account settings and tools allow you to exercise, as outlined below.
\r\n<b>Accessing Data.</b> By logging into your account, you can access much of your personal information, including your dashboard and setting.

If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your information will be deleted within 10 days, it may take up to 60 days to delete all of your information, like the data recorded by your Liteguardian device and other data stored in our backup systems. This is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data.
\r\n<b>Objecting to Data Use. </b>We give you account settings and tools to control our data use. For example, through your privacy settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services; using your notification settings, you can limit the notifications you receive from us.

\r\n<b>DATA RETENTION</b>
\r\nWe keep your account information, like your name, email address and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account. In some cases, when you give us information for a feature of the Services, we delete the data after it is no longer needed for the feature. We also keep information about you and your use of the Services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm.

\r\n<b>ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS</b>
\r\nWe work with partners who provide us with analytics and advertising services. This includes helping us understand how users interact with the Services, serving advertisements on our behalf across the internet, and measuring the performance of those advertisements. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interactions with the Services and other websites and applications. 

\r\n<b>INFORMATION SECURITY</b>
\r\nWe work hard to keep your data safe. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data. This includes using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt many of our Services. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however.

\r\n<b>PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES</b>
\r\nWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as we add new products and apps, as we improve our current offerings and as technologies and laws change. Any changes will become effective upon our posting of the revised Privacy Policy.
\r\nWe will provide notice to you if these changes are material and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. This notice will be provided by email or by posting notice of the changes on the Liteguardian websites and apps that link to this Privacy Policy.</string>
